# MY DATA STRUCTURE & ALGORITHM JOURNEY.....

**09-09-2023**
Welcome to my DSA journey! I have always aspired to secure a position in top MNC companies, and to achieve that dream, I am committed to strengthening my Data Structures and Algorithms skills. In this README, I will share my daily progress and learning experiences.
## Progress Update
**Array:** I started my DSA journey by diving into the array a few days ago, and I'm thrilled to announce that I have successfully completed this topic.

## Current Focus
I am currently focusing on two important DSA concepts:
1. **Linear Search:** I am actively learning and practicing the Linear Search algorithm to understand its principles and applications.
2. **Binary Search:** I am delving into the Binary Search algorithm, aiming to grasp its intricacies and improve my problem-solving abilities.

## Next Steps
My plan for the near future includes working on coding questions on platforms like LeetCode and CodeChef. I am excited to face new challenges and expand my DSA knowledge.

Stay tuned for regular updates on my DSA journey and progress. Feel free to join me in this exciting adventure of continuous learning and growth!

Happy coding!
